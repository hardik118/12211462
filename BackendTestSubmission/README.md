## Key Files & Folders

- **src/**  
  Contains all backend application logic.
  - **controllers/**: Functions that handle incoming HTTP requests and interact with models/services.
  - **models/**: Database schema definitions (e.g., for MongoDB/Mongoose, Sequelize, etc.).
  - **routes/**: Defines REST API endpoints and maps them to controller functions.
  - **middlewares/**: Custom logic that runs during request processing (e.g., authentication, error handling).
  - **utils/**: Helper functions used throughout the backend.
  - **app.js**: Sets up the server application (Express instance, middleware registration, etc.).
  - **server.js**: Starts the server and listens on the configured port.

- **tests/**  
  Contains unit/integration tests for backend logic and endpoints.

- **.env.example**  
  Template for environment variables required to run the backend (e.g., database URLs, secrets).

- **package.json & package-lock.json**  
  - `package.json` lists dependencies, scripts (start, test, lint, etc.), and project metadata.
  - `package-lock.json` locks dependency versions for reproducible builds.

- **README.md**  
  This documentation file.

## How It Works

1. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Run `npm install` to install all required packages.

2. **Configuration:**  
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required environment variables.

3. **Running the Server:**  
   Use `npm start` or `npm run dev` (if using nodemon) to start the server.  
   The server will listen for HTTP requests and route them through the logic defined in `src/`.

4. **API Structure:**  
   All endpoints are defined in `src/routes/`, which link to their respective controllers.
   - Controllers process the request, validate input, interact with models, and return responses.
   - Models define how backend data is stored and retrieved.
   - Middleware handles authentication, logging, error handling, etc.

5. **Testing:**  
   Run `npm test` to execute automated tests in the `tests/` folder.

## Example Functionality

- **User Authentication:**  
  Handled via middleware and controller logic—users authenticate via API endpoints, tokens are checked on protected routes.

- **CRUD API:**  
  Standard create, read, update, delete operations are implemented in controllers and exposed via routes.

- **Error Handling:**  
  All errors are caught and managed by middleware for consistent API responses.

## Notes

- Project uses Node.js and Express (or similar) for backend logic.
- Follows best practices: separation of concerns, modular code, environment-based config, and proper error handling.
- TypeScript may be used (check for `tsconfig.json`).
